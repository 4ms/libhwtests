###libhwtest

A set of tools for hardware integration tests for embedded systems, focused mainly on front-end UI (buttons, switches, pots, jacks) and peripherals.

Many of the tests involve user interaction. For example to test an LED button the user must push the button and confirm the light turns on or off.

Very much a WIP!

Todo:
  * ADC input range tester
    * Helper callbacks for ADC input range testers.
  * ADC channel isolation tester
  * DAC/Codec output test helper callback functions
  * Generic I2C peripheral ping tester
  * Codec input helper callback functions
  * LED Button tester
  * Toggle switch tester (2 or 3 position)
  * Gate input tester
  * Gate output tester
  * FLASH RAM tester
  * LED tester
